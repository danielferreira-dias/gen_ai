      "query": "How do I get from Porto airport to the city center?",

      "query": "What's the best time of year to visit Porto?",
      "expected_response": "The best time to visit Porto is during late spring (May-June) or early fall (September-October). During these months, you'll enjoy pleasant temperatures (18-25°C), fewer crowds than summer, and lower prices. Summer (July-August) is warm and lively but crowded. Winter (December-February) is mild but rainier, though it's great for experiencing Port wine culture indoors. São João Festival in June is a highlight if you enjoy local celebrations."

      "id": "gt_006",
      "query": "Is Porto a walkable city?",
      "expected_response": "Yes, Porto is very walkable, especially the historic center and Ribeira district. However, be prepared for steep hills and cobblestone streets, so wear comfortable walking shoes. The city is built on hills along the Douro River, which means some areas require climbing. For longer distances or to save energy, use the Metro, historic trams (Line 1), or the funicular (Funicular dos Guindais). Walking is the best way to discover Porto's charming narrow streets and hidden corners."

      "id": "gt_007",
      "query": "What neighborhoods should I stay in Porto?",
      "expected_response": "The best neighborhoods to stay in Porto are: Ribeira (riverside charm, very touristy but atmospheric), Baixa/City Center (central location, good transport links), Cedofeita (trendy, artsy, with boutiques and cafes), Foz do Douro (beachside, more residential and quieter), and Miragaia (authentic, close to attractions but less crowded). Ribeira and Baixa are ideal for first-time visitors wanting to be near major sights. Cedofeita suits those wanting a local vibe with nightlife."

However, learning basic phrases like 'obrigado/a' (thank you), 'por favor' (please), and 'bom dia' (good morning) is appreciated by locals. In less touristy neighborhoods or traditional establishments, English may be limited, but people are generally friendly and helpful."

These beaches are easily accessible by tram or bus from the city center (20-30 minutes). The water is typically cool (16-20°C) even in summer due to Atlantic currents. Beaches have facilities, restaurants, and are great for sunset walks."

      "query": "What traditional foods should I try in Porto besides Francesinha?",
      "expected_response": "Beyond Francesinha, must-try Porto foods include: Bacalhau (salted cod prepared many ways), Tripas à moda do Porto (tripe stew, Porto's traditional dish), Alheira (smoked sausage), Caldo Verde (kale and potato soup), Polvo à Lagareiro (octopus with olive oil and potatoes), Pastéis de Nata (custard tarts), and Pão de Ló (sponge cake).

    {
      "id": "gt_015",
      "query": "How many days do I need to visit Porto?",
      "expected_response": "I recommend spending 2-3 days in Porto to see the main attractions comfortably. With 2 days, you can cover the historic center, Ribeira, Port wine cellars, and major landmarks. With 3 days, you can explore at a more relaxed pace, visit neighborhoods like Foz or Cedofeita, and take a day trip to Douro Valley or Guimarães. If you have more time, 4-5 days allows for multiple day trips and deeper exploration of Porto's food scene, markets, and hidden gems. The city is compact enough for a weekend but offers plenty for longer stays."
